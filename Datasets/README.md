# Algorithm2Domain-Datasets

This folder contains scripts that help you turn time-series datasets into the format required by the Algorithm2Domain Evaluation Framework.

## Work in progress
[Algorithm2Domain](https://github.com/BI-K/Algorithm2Domain) is  a meta-repository for benchmarking of domain adaptation performance managed by the [Institute for Biomedical Informatics](https://bik.uni-koeln.de/) (University Hospital of Cologne).
Our goal is to aggregate existing algorithms and benchmarking suits, and develop integrative pipelines for mix-and-match cross-domain benchmarking. The data sources suitable for the benchmarking will be aggregated as pointers. 

This repository acts as a databse for datasets useful for benchmarking domain adaptation algorithms. Apart from providing an overview over suitable benchmark datasets and the way they have been used to assess domain adaptation, dataset-sepcific scripts that preparet hem for the benchmark suites supported by Algorithm2Domain are provided here.

## Wiki
In the Wiki we aggregate knowledge regarding domain adaptation and related topics: generalizability, out-of-distribution performance etc., as well as different methods to improve the algorithm design and to efficiently adapt it to the new domain.
