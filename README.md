## Work in progress
Algorithm2Domain is  a meta-repository for benchmarking of domain adaptation performance managed by [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) consortium and the [Institute for Biomedical Informatics](https://bik.uni-koeln.de/) (University Hospital of Cologne).
Our goal is to aggregate existing algorithms and benchmarking suits, and develop integrative pipelines for mix-and-match cross-domain benchmarking. The data sources suitable for the benchmarking will be aggregated as pointers. 

This repository will contain a integrative benchmarking suite, that connects the datasets, models, domain adaptation algorithms, few-shot approaches and datasets from various domain adaptation benchmarking suites. 
For now our seed benchmarking suite is ADATime by *by: Mohamed Ragab\*, Emadeldeen Eldele\*,  Wee Ling Tan, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Zhenghua Chen<sup>&#9768;</sup>, Min Wu, Chee Kwoh, Xiaoli Li*.
