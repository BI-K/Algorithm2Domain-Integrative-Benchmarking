# [Algorithm2Domain](https://github.com/BI-K/Algorithm2Domain) - Guidelines and Standards

## Work in progress
[Algorithm2Domain](https://github.com/BI-K/Algorithm2Domain) is  a meta-repository for benchmarking of domain adaptation performance managed by the [Institute for Biomedical Informatics](https://bik.uni-koeln.de/) (University Hospital of Cologne).
Our goal is to aggregate existing algorithms and benchmarking suits, and develop integrative pipelines for mix-and-match cross-domain benchmarking. The data sources suitable for the benchmarking will be aggregated as pointers. 

This repository collects guidelines and stanadards regarding the devlopement of models for out-of-domain distribution (related to domain adaptation, few-shot learning and transfer learning). Standards to follow when benchmarking approaches and the way datasets and domains should be described.

## Wiki
In the Wiki we aggregate knowledge regarding domain adaptation and related topics: generalizability, out-of-distribution performance etc., as well as different methods to improve the algorithm design and to efficiently adapt it to the new domain.
